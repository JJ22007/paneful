# One-time setup for people who build Paneful from source.
#
# Problem: an ad-hoc signed app gets a new identity on every build, so macOS
# drops its Accessibility permission each time (and the switch in System
# Settings may still look on). Fix: sign every build with the same local,
# self-signed certificate. You then grant the permission once and it sticks.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. creates a self-signed code-signing certificate named "Paneful Local Signing"
#      in your login keychain (it is only ever used to sign your own builds)
#   2. clears stale Accessibility entries left by earlier builds
#   3. rebuilds, installs and launches Paneful
#
# macOS may ask for your login password the first time codesign uses the new
# key. Choose "Always Allow".
#
# To undo: delete "Paneful Local Signing" in Keychain Access.
